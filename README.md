# BASICS_OF_STATISTICS_WITH_PYTHON

## Some examples and exercises using python and its packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib and others) to analyze data statistically

It is worth sayng that statistics in general applies for a large amount of data, due to the increasing number of data (information) sources with the modern technology.

For this reason it's important knowing some computational tools like the following languages and its packages which help us visualizing, organize and analysing great amount of data:

Language  & Package
_____________________________________________
Python  -->   Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib...

R       -->   Not listed.


SQL     -->   Not listed.

Here we gonna learn how to use the Python language an its packages to analyse data and obtain statistical information of it. So, for this, one must have installed or access to some python interpreter (on your computer or on-line, as Jupyter Notebook) like Pycharm, Anaconda Spyder and others.
